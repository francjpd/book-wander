## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

We need to build a travels and bookings management system consisting of 2 pages:

- one to manage travel
- one to manage booking.

### Travel

1. The travels should have some basic informations like:

   - Name of the travel,
   - Departure date
   - Return date,
   - A picture
   - Description of the tour,
   - Price for a single person
   - verage user rating.

2. Travels should be listed in a dedicated page with a table and some basic filters.

3. The user should be able to:
   - Use a form to add a new travel
   - Edit an existing travel
   - Delete a travel

### The booking
1. The bookings should hold those info:
    - The related travel
    - Customer infos
    - Payment type
    - eventual internal notes.

2. Bookings should be listed in a dedicated page with a table
3. A booking can be created with a dedicated multi-step form (wizard):
    - first step: search and select the related travel
    - second step: fill the customer info in a dedicated form (name, email, phone number, age, gender)
    - third step: select the payment type (Credit transfer, Paypal, Revolut) and optionally add some notes

# Notes
The backend/API part can be mocked (no database, optional validation, just mocked data) and implemented in the way the candidate prefers, for example with nuxt server routes or a dedicated simple server.

For every other detail not explicitly written in this docs, the candidate can independently design and build the way they prefer.
